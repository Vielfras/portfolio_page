# Version 2.0.0

This portfolio is designed to my personal taste, when the design challange I gave myself to make a black and white design.

It's main purpose is to give a first taste of what elements I would like to have in my future portfolio page.

The goal of making the portfolio page was to improve my CSS and JS knowladge.

I learned a lot by working on it. 
My main difficulty became managing all the CSS which lead me to learn WebComponents, whuch I plan to use more of for the next version of the portfolio page.


## Personal Project:
The pages are random application I'm working on to learn and improve my JavaScript knowladge.
1. Evernote
2. TTRPG Character Page
