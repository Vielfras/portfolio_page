# Version 1

This portfolio is designed to the specification given by HackerU.

It's main purpose is to give a first taste of what a portfolio page is and the basic elements that it should present.

Currently, there is no JS functionality or personal touches as this was an exercise for me to test my skill at implementing as close to a pixel perfect design as the one that was provided by the "client".

I learned a lot by working on it. Mainly on the advantages and disadvanteages of Bootstrap and SASS, but also about the correct workflow of implementing a design that is not my own.

## Client Designs:
By order of implementation, 1st being the one I implenmented first:
1. Here And Now
2. Travel Advertisement
3. Let Us Lead You Forward - purple
4. Let Us Lead You Forward - black & blue

## Personal Designs:
The pages are random application I'm working on to learn and improve my JavaScript knowladge.
1. Evernote
2. Clicker game
3. TTRPG Character Page


# Version 2 Roadmap
- Move all personal project pages to their own repositories and add them as submodules to this one.
- Add basic JS functionality the the landing page.
