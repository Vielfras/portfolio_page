## Aspects
Unlike {Skills}, they affect one's body, changing it to mirror the received aspects.
> [!Important]
> Extremely rare.
> Require very specific conditions.
> - Ex. Horror Ranks 


## Conditions
Status effects that a person can gain through many different methods. 
It is possible to lose a condition.
- Ex:
	- Losing the class/horror rank that gave the condition in the 1st place.
	- Curing the disease that the condition represents.
	

## Miracles
An older, nearly extinct form of magic, although it is questioned if it even is magic.
Basically a form of prayer brought into existence.
Miracles relied in the faith and belief in gods. As the gods have long since ceased to exist, at least in the eyes of the public, so have miracles likewise ended.

## Memories
Memories of old, passed and taken form.
While the outcome changes, memories usually give the individual a time period where they can access the memories and {Skills} of some person they know/remember.
The person being remembered can even take control over the individuals body for that time period, being able to utalise his knowledge and {Skills} to their full potential.

## Songs
> [1 Important]
> Potentially unique to the bard class.


## Synergies
Similar to Combination Skills, they require multiple components to work.
- Ex. Multiple species.
	- {Gnoll-Drake Command}- Gnolls and Drakes under command of the one with the Synergy will temporarily obtain traits of the other species.
		- Better sense of smell and hearing for the Drakes.
		- Breath weapon ability for the Gnolls.
