# Summary
- GM heavy system.
- Requires constant inventing of new {Classes}, {Skills} and systems.
	- Requiers good comunication between the GM and the players with the players understanding that the Classes/Skills can be buffed/nerfed at anytime by the GM.
- **!!! Balance is not important !!!**
	- While I will take care not to make Classes/Skills too overpowered, I don't mind if some classes are inherintly weaker/worse than others.
	- I don't play TTRPG for the min/maxing experience and if a player does than as a GM I will just make his enemies/challanges fit him.
		- It is my role as a GM to make the story/game interesting/chalanging for the players, and if they want to feel OP I will make them feel OP.

# Why a new system?
After my last duet turned into a full campaign for our usual group of friends me and my SO decided it was time to start a new one.
After talking out what the expectations were and what the setting/character my SO wanted to play in/as, I realised that Wirstram would be a perfect basis for the start of the campaign.
After making a homebrew world loosely based on Inn World I realized that to make a propper magic school experience D&D 5e rules were not enough and decided to create a new system.

This repository is this attempt at making a TTRPG system for the duet.
> [!Note]
> I'll be filling out all the missing pieces with D&D 5e rules as that is what my duet partner is experienced with.


# Making a Character
Characters can start at any level/class they want. It is considered that a character usually gets his first class/skill aroung the age of 8 years.
- When making a background, characters need to provide information on how they got their class/es and reached their current level/s.

## Begginer playthrough:
Characters start at level 10.

They can choose whatever distribution of classes/levels they want.
- Charcters get 1 character specific unique skill every 10 levels and so they can start with 1 unique skill of their choice.
