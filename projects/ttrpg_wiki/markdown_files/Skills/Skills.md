# Skills

Magic-like abilities that are intended to exceed one’s limits, such as allowing someone to transcend their hardest strike and turn it into something even stronger.

Skills are more basic with lower levels and gain power or scope with higher levels. When attempting to influence other beings with high levels and/or Skills, the effects may be lessened or canceled.

kills can improve one’s ability greatly and even give them the means to do things they would never be able to do normally, like fish, work metal, or even fight. But a Skill improves on what was already there. For example, if two {Warriors} with the same levels and Skills fought, the one who had trained longer and had more actual combat experience would inevitably prevail. Similarly, if someone had {Basic Cooking}, but they had never made food, all their cooking would be just that: basic.
- This comes into effect with the Training game mechanic, where one can practice and train Spells/Skills.
