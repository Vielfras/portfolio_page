## Magic System
Combines two systems.
1. **Structured** 
	- Class & Skill based.

2. **Unstructured**
	- Allows casting any variation of a known magic.
		- Ex. If player knows [Light], can control the spell to produce different colors, spread, brightness, etc...
			- This requires extra effort from the player.
			- So if the [Light] spell is a "Cantrip"(stand in word for what the level of the spell would be) and can be cast as a bonus action in combat or whenever out of combat, than an unstructured cast requires an extra dice throw, the outcome of which determines the result of the spell.
				- This way an unstructured spell can fail.
> [!Note]
> If a spell already requires a dice throw to determine success, than an Unstructured cast makes the success DC higher, or even be a disadvantaged throw.

## Mana
All spells cost mana.
The higher the spells rank the more mana it will cost, although it is a generalization and not a rule.

Mana is restored by:
- Rest
- Potions

Casting spells and using mana requires calories as well. Not only is there a "mana bar" but a "hunger bar".
- A mage that is starving might not be able to cast spells.

## Tier Magic
Spells are organized into different Tiers based on effect and strength.

A spell capable of being cast by all mages is generally thought of as Tier 0 or Tier 1 Magic, while a spell that belongs to Tier 2 is more potent, requiring a better mage and longer periods of study to learn it. Tier 3 magic is generally the bar for most mages, with most knowing only one or two spells of that level. Anything higher gets into the range of extremely powerful magic, becoming exponentially stronger and just as hard to learn.

To cast spells of specific tiers, it usually requires for the mage to have reached a certain level.

However, lower-level mages can cast higher Tier magic with enough practice and time.Â 

### Tier Progression
All magics can be increased in strength/affect.
- A player can choose to practice a magic spell.
	- At the permission of the DM, in between long rests, the player can choose to practice his magic.
		- Throw a dice + Int or Wiz modifier.
		- The result is added to a pool for that specific skill.
		- Ex. Tier 1 {Stone Dart} requires 200 points to upgrade.
			- Result can be +1 to damage, added effects, reduced mana cost or even an extra pebble.
- The point of this system is to allow each player to customise his spells to his play style and keep lower level spells useful.
